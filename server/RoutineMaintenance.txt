Care and Feeding of the Blockly Games Server.

Routine system maintenance (suggest monthly):
SSH to your account on the server.
Once connected, issue the following commands:
> sudo apt-get update
> sudo apt-get upgrade

To push a new version of Blockly Games:
> sudo su - bg-user
>   cd blockly-games
>   git pull
>   make  # Watch this step to ensure no errors!
>   make stage
>   make deploy
>   exit
After staging, test http://staging.blockly.games to verify proper functionality.
After deployment, immediately test https://blockly.games to verify everything's good.

If there are updates to the web server config:
> sudo cp ~bg-user/blockly-games/server/*.conf /etc/nginx/sites-available/
> sudo nginx -s reload

To access the admin page, point a web browser at: https://blockly.games/admin
Although the admin page doesn't require authentication, many of the pages it
links to do.  The username is 'admin'.

As of April 2024 the gallery moderation is not usable due to team priorities.
